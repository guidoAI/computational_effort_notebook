    "In [1], Viola and Jones introduced a very efficient object detection algorithm. As most other object detectors of the time, it sees object detection as a binary _classification problem_; It runs a window over the entire image at various scales and for each sample classifies it as the object of interest or not. The computational efficiency of the method derives from the use of integral images - allowing the quick determination of 'Haar' feature values irrespective of their scale - and the use of cascades of weak classifiers - allowing to quickly reject most samples, before extracting too many features from the sample.\n",

It runs the OpenCV face detector on the images. You will see a new window that shows the images and detections (with green boxes), and you will see below a print-out with a carriage return of the number of faces found and the time that the algorithm takes in seconds.\n",
